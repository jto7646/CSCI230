 Create 2 hashing functions, frank used one off of page 423 line 28.
	- They both need to return int
 
 "Whenever we put something into our HashTable, we calculate
	our key using both the [first and the second] hash functions.
	Look in the buckets cooresponding to [the two hashcodes].
	Whichever bucket is less full, add the key to that bucket."

 Run the two hashcodes in the start of the put function, compare the keys in both buckets.
 When getting the values out, we will need to use both of the hash codes to check both buckets
	for the info.

Make the two hash functions(DONE: WORKING), then edit the put(DONE: WORKING), get(DONE: WORKING-ISH), and remove functions(DONE: WORKING-ISH), then lab done.
