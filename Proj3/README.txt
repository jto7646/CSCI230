
A small guide to the work that I did in the project.

The Classes That I Built:
	- CharCounter.java (counts the characters in the file)
	- TreeBuilder.java (builds huffman trees)
	- HuffEncoder.java (creates huff codes for the characters)
	- TerminalDriver.java (simple driver that starts the program)

The Classes That I edited:
	- SimpleHuffProcessor.java
		^ Pre-made with empty functions, I built the functions
	- HuffViewer.java
		^ Pre-made class used for gui. I added some functions and buttons

			- prntCharCodes() function on line 296
