Plagiarism Project:

	Requirements:
	- The input will be a set of plain text documents and a number n
	- The output will be some representation showing the number of n-word sequences
		each document has in common with every other document in the set
	- Need to identify "suspicious" groups of documents that share many common word 
		sequences among themsevles
	- Program should accept aditional input representing the detectio threshhold, which is the 
		number of matches for a pair of documents above which plagarism is flagged
	
	
	My requirements:
	- need to read in from nmore than one file at a time, pass in a folder maybe?
	- Create a gui, if have the time
	- Make a list ordered by the number of hits? BST for quick searching, maybe?
	- need to come up with a way to compare the n sized word chunks...
		- read in six words, all of the characters between spaces ( for first document )
		- read in six words for next document, comparing them to the words from the first.
		- go through the rest of the documents in this fashion
		- Compare six word chunks in second document with the rest of the folder, ignoring the first
			(already compared)
		- (BST might hold sets, only allows for one of each weight)
